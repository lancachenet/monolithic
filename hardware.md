# Hardware examples and throughput 

## Introduction

This project is heavily reliant on the hardware that you run it on.  The most 
common complaint is "The cache is slow" and in nearly every case this can be 
attributed to the hardware that the cache is being run on.


The following hardware specifications are real-world examples of hardware that
has been used to run this project, so you can get an idea of the type of 
performance that you can expect from varying hardware setups.



## High Capacity

24 CPU core, 140GB memory, 8 x Samsung 850 Pro SSD in RAID6
Served ~2,800 uniques, peaking at 10Gbps


## Medium capacity

24 CPU core, 180GB memory, 5 x 900GB 15K SAS drives, plus 180GB SSD (lvmcache)
Served ~250 uniques, peaking at 1.8Gbps

## Low capacity
